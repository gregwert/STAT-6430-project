# STAT-6430-project

The repository for our group project

## Objective 1:
*Almost done, all that remains is to merge in ProjClass

## Outstanding Issues:
* For some reason, I can only run the step that outputs Master once per session. If I edit it and try to run it again in the same session, it never overwrites properly. No issues with any other data steps.
* Can't order the variables properly with retain when I create Master4
